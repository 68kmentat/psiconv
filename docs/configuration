Starting with version 0.9.0, all applications linked against libpsiconv
(including the psiconv program in this package) will try to read a
configuration file psiconv.conf. It is sought for in PSICONVETCDIR
(--with-etcdir option in configure, defaults to PREFIX/etc) and in the
homedirectory of the current user. Programs can add other location to
this path. If more than one configuration file is found, they are all
read in order (first the one in PSICONVETCDIR, then the one in ~, 
finally any additional locations added by the program), and settings in
later files overrule settings in earlier files.

In PSICONVETCDIR an example configuration file psiconv.conf.eg is always
installed. Older versions are overwritten. If no psiconv.conf file is
present, a copy one will be created from the psiconv.conf.eg file. Be
careful if you use DESTDIR to install at a temporary place, because it
will not find the psiconv.conf file and install a new one.
