Starting with psiconv 0.9.0, all strings are internally represented using
Unicode, with the UCS2 encoding. This encodes every Unicode codepoint with
a 16-bit unsigned integer.

The codepoints 0x06 to 0x0f are treated specially. They are not translated, 
and keep their Psion-specific meanings:
  0x06: New paragraph
  0x07: New line
  0x08: Hard page
  0x09: Tab
  0x0a: Unbreakable tab
  0x0b: Unbreakable hyphen
  0x0c: Potential hyphen
  0x0d: Unknown
  0x0e: Object placeholder
  0x0f: Visible space
