This README provides information about the psiconv HTML4 output generator.

Output files generated using the options -T HTML use only HTML 4.01 to
format their text. This has some drawbacks, as several layout options are
not available in plain HTML. The good news is that almost any browser
should accept the generated HTML and render the page in an acceptable way.

Note that tabs, headers and footers are not rendered at all. Especially
the omission of tabs can cause ugly layouts. Unfortunately, there is not
a real solution for this.
